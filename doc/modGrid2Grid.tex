\subsection{modGrid2Grid}

\subsubsection{Description}

\texttt{modGrid2Grid} is not a class but a Fortan module which contains an array of \texttt{Vol2Vol} classes and subroutines to communicate with other languages. The module structure is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:modGrid2GridStructure}. It has two static data which are input data array and \texttt{Vol2Vol} array not to have and update multiple \texttt{Vol2Vol} classes for efficiency and to save memory. When \texttt{Grid2Grid} is initialized from a program written in another language, it firstly check the input variables and return \texttt{HOSIndex}. If the same input variables are given, it returns the same \texttt{HOSIndex} and does not allocate nor initialise \texttt{Vol2Vol}. Other languages can distiguish different HOS wave theory by using the \texttt{HOSIndex}.
The subroutines \texttt{correct} and \texttt{get*} can be called with \texttt{HOSIndex}, position and time. 

The array size of \texttt{modGrid2Grid} is 100 by default (It can deal with 100 different HOS waves) but it does not consume much memory because classes of \texttt{Grid2Grid} are programmed with dynamic arrays and consequently only a few of static data are used. If more HOS wave theories are needed, the variable \texttt{nMaxVol2Vol} in \texttt{src/modGrid2Grid.f90} can be changed to deal with over than 100 different HOS wave theory. 

The functionality of \texttt{modGrid2Grid} is almost the same with \texttt{Vol2Vol}.
